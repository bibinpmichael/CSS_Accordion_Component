# Accordion Component

This project demonstrates a simple and stylish accordion component for web development. The accordion is a common UI pattern used to toggle the visibility of content, allowing users to show and hide information as needed.

## Features

- Responsive design
- Smooth transitions
- Customizable styles
- Easy to integrate into existing projects

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the accordion
- `styles.css`: The CSS file with all the styles for the accordion component

## Usage

1. Include the `styles.css` file in your HTML:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```

2. Copy the HTML structure from `index.html` into your project:
   ```html
   <div class="accordion">
     <div class="item">
       <!-- Accordion item content -->
     </div>
     <!-- Add more items as needed -->
   </div>
   ```

3. Customize the content and styles as needed for your project.

## Customization

- To change the colors, modify the CSS variables in the `styles.css` file.
- To add more accordion items, duplicate the `<div class="item">` structure in the HTML.
- To have an item open by default, add the `open` class to the item's div.

## Browser Support

This accordion component should work in all modern browsers that support CSS Grid and Flexbox.
